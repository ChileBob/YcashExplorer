# Important !

Those paying attention may notice the 'ycash.cl' domain, which is the country-level domain for Chile.

The domain does not belong to the Ycash Foundation & everything hosted on it is unofficial.

I hereby grant the Ycash Foundation authority over my use of the 'ycash.cl' domain & will take it down on their request.
